# MapComplete ThemeHelper

## Goals

a. Make it easier to develop Themes for MapComplete.

b. Host Themes by the OSM Berlin Community that are not relevant for the broader MapComplete Userbase. But provide a nice sharabale Link for those Themes. We use Github Pages for that.

## ThemeHelper

[See `./ThemeHelper`](./ThemeHelper) for how to use the theme helper.

## OSM Berlin Themes

[See `./OSM-Berlin-Themes`](./OSM-Berlin-Themes) for a list of themes. They have their own readme files.
